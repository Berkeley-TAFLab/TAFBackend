# TAFBackend 

## Description 
Please use this README as the documentation of how to use our endpoints to communicate 
with our database. These are the endpoints that will be exposed in our frontendUI that  
lets us store and modify data collected from our boats. 

## IMPORTANT NOTE 
As of January 29th, this API is not actively on an accessible machine. Thus, if you would 
like to use this API, please clone the repo and run the app.py file locally.
